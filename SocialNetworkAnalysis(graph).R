diameter(g1, directed=F, weights = NA) # Itâ€™s the greatest distance (in terms of the number of edges) you would need to travel to go from one node to another, considering the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in the graph.
edge_density(g1, loops=F) # Edge density is a measure of how many edges are present in a graph compared to the maximum possible number of edges.

reciprocity(g1) #  calculates the reciprocity of a graph, which is a measure of how many reciprocal edges exist between pairs of nodes.
closeness(g1, mode = 'all', weights=NA) # closeness to other vertexes, calculates the closeness centrality of the nodes in the graph g1. Closeness centrality measures how close a node is to all other nodes in the graph, based on the shortest paths between nodes.
betweenness(g1, directed = T, weights=NA) # Betweenness centrality measures how often a node acts as a "bridge" along the shortest path between other nodes. A node with high betweenness has control over the flow of information or resources between other nodes.
edge_betweenness(g1, directed = T, weights=NA) #  Edge betweenness centrality measures how often an edge is part of the shortest path between two nodes. An edge with high betweenness is important for connecting different parts of the graph.
